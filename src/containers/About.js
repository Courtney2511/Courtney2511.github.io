            My name is Courtney. I am a Sales professional turned Web Developer.
            In May 2016 I completed the Full Stack Web Development Intensive at
            Bitmaker in Toronto. After completion of the program, I wanted to
            continue working on my development skills and enrolled in the Full
            Stack Web Development nanodegree offered through Udacity. I enjoyed
            the course so much that I also completed the React nanodegree that
            they offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of web development, I like to live an active healthy
            lifestyle. On summer weekends you can catch me up north with the
            family and dog on our boat sailing the waters of Lake Simcoe.
